0_README.txt for NWB MatLab examples

Directories are:

create_scripts   - scripts used to create sample NWB files

created_nwb_files  - location of where example NWB files will be created

text_output_files  - location for storing output of unittests and examples
                     This directory is created by scripts that run the
                     unittests and examples.

../../examples/source_data_2  (Not located here, but needs to be installed
    in order to run the crcns_alm_1.m example script).  This directory is
    installed by the "install_source_data.py" script in directory
    ../../examples/utility_scripts.

To run the create_scripts, go into the directory (in Matlab) and run
the script by typing the name into the command line.

*** These require that the matlab NWB bridge is setup.  See the instructions
in the 0_INSTALL.txt file in the directory above this one.
