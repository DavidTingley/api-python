"""
Create a module that stores experimental intervals

Modules represent intermediate processing of experimental data,
something that must be done to the acquired data before it is 
ready for experimental analysis. Processing examples are spike 
clustering (ephys) and image segmentation (ophys). 

In this example, a processing module is created that stores 
intervals marking a particular behavior, and it is assumed that
this behavior is only determinable by post-processing of acquired
data.
