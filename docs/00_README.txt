This directory contains documentation for the NWB Python (and Matlab) API.
The documentation can be built on Unix-like systems by entering:

"make html"      - to make html documentation
"make latexpdf"  - to make PDF documentation
"make"           - to see the different types of documentation available

On Windows systems, "make.bat" can be used to generate documentation.

Documentation will be created in directory "build".
